<p style="text-align:center;">Hallo, welcome, come on in..</p>

It is about journal of journey.
It is neither an itinerary, nor a diary.
Rather writing which tends to be inquiry.

The writing which about an effort to be present
in the reality that exist and be aware of things that happen in it.
An attempt to walk down the alley
and see everything through a frame of view.
All of this is done to find reference patterns of thought.

The served writing can be enjoyed in concise form on [Medium](https://medium.com/@laminseima) 
or in more elaborate fashion on [Substack](https://laminseima.substack.com).

Hopefully what is served can enrich your perspective
in an agenda to build your days that haven't happened yet.

If you have a bit curiosity about the host (author),
